Large Language Models, and chatbots, and ChatGPT, and 'AI' are thrown around like buzzwords in most conversations centred around artificial intelligence, and the blackbox that is Levenstein distancing and LLMs is intriguing. I made this chatbot with support for my homecity's most widely spoken language, Sheng', because language is deeply personal. And we relate best using this cultural concept and tool. This is for all my fellow Nairobians. My longterm vision is to transform this corpus into a health educational tool for my city's, and country's people. Named after the famed Aesir god for his legendary chattiness, wit, and knowledge.
