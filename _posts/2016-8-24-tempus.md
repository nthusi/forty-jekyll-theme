Most health management information systems aren't intuitive to clinicians because they aren't built by clinicians. I built this from scratch to automate bottlenecks, and menial tasks that take away valuable time in patient care, and waste valuable time that a clinician could rechannel to the same patient and to others to increase efficiency, and generate more value from an ethical business perspective.
