From the turqoise waters, and pearl white sandy beaches of Tiwi in Kenya, and to the pitch black grains, and murky waters of the Baltic sea in Germany. From the chaotic and noisy avenues of my homecity Nairobi, to the quiet and sour streets sprinkled with cartoonish houses by Gaudi in Barcelona, and to the humid, slow, and aromatic streets in Moshi. To the middleearth looking montane valleys, Death Stranding resembling tarn lakes of Mt. Kenya, to the otherworldly alpine desert of Mt. Kilimanjaro, and to the magnificent, excalibur doppleganger that is the face of Matterhorn in the Alps. To the pitchblack nightskies sprinkled with stardust of the Mara, to the endless starlit nightsky of the Amboseli, and to the naked galaxy revealing dark desert skies of the Marsabit. And to the winding and narrowing valley of Aosta, to the rustic looking, and gothic remnants of Innsbroke my adventurous spirit has dissected my introverted cocoon, and driven me to a snippet of this pale blue dot we call home.
